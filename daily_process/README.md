Daily Process
=============

The idea for this poster cam directly from one of the [How
I Work](http://lifehacker.com/how-i-work/) series of
interviews on Lifehacker with [Zack
Frechette](http://lifehacker.com/5976408/im-zach-frechette-founder-of-quarterly-co-and-this-is-how-i-work)

It's based on Zacks dail process as shown in [this
image](http://img.gawkerassets.com/post/17/2013/01/zachfwhiteboard.png).

As in other projects, this is an example of abusing OpenOffice Draw to do
things I don't think it was really intended to do. 

Theme
-----
Overall, the look I was aiming for was an opticians eye chart. The black font
in varying sizes with red and green thrown in for testin long/short
sighted-ness

Layout
------
This is a relatively simple layout. Apart from the horizontal lines dividing
the sections, and the "T" in the email section which are just regular lines,
everything else is done with plain old text boxes. Other than tweaking the
spacking of fonts to get different sized words to align everyting else is just
font face changes for bold and color.

The font used is Consolas, a fixed with font that I use in order to make alignment 
and layout easier.

If I were starting again, I think I would go with a more formal grid layout but
I'm still happy with the results.

The poster is for an A4 page and looks nice when printed and with the excess
white paper guillotined off.

Modify as needed
----------------
This is more of a template than a final image, and I intend tweaking it a bit
more to suit my personal process. For the baseline document I wanted to stay
close to the original image that inpired it.

Speaking which, thanks to Zack for the inspiration.
