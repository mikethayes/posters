Calendars
=======

This one was a real reverse engineering project. Inspired by the lovely [2013
Linear Calendar][http://themadeshop.goodsie.com/2013-linear-calendar] from [The
Made Shop](http://www.themadeshop.com/) that I discovered via
[BLTD](http://www.betterlivingthroughdesign.com), this was a great challenge.

If you look at the Draw documents you can see some of the iterations I went
through to get to this.

For this one in particular, grouping objects and then using the *Arrange* and
*Distribution* tools was key to getting the layout right.

Of course, the results aren't perfect - even using a fixed width font, with
grid alignment, there's still some minor discrepancies in the layout which
I would have to put down to font rendering.

Initially I created a large version, and then scaled it down for A4 printing.
This exaggerates the discrepancies if anything, but is still reasonably
acceptable.

To be fair to the the guys at The Made Shop, if you want one of these calendars
go buy one from them - they print on nice paper and theirs will look way
better. 
That said, on a personal note, I don't think this calendar would work for me as
a "whole" year calendar, but it still looks great!
