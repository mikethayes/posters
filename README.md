posters
=======

In which I abuse OpenOffice Draw to create posters that would probably be
better done in some other package.

Background
----------
Once upon a time I was part of the StarOffice team in Sun Microsystems. As
a result I got to know the suite of tools quite well, and for better or worse
I've fallen into the habit of using OpenOffice Draw for any diagrams or images
I need to create.

Recently, I've seen some inforgraphics and posters and thought "I wonder if
I could do that in Draw". Really, I've discovered a few tricks along the way
that make it easier and although the results are variable, it's intersting to
"reverse engineer" the process and see how far you can push things with
something like Draw.
